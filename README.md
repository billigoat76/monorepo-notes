## 📌 What Are Monorepos?

As the name suggests, a **monorepo** is a single repository (e.g., on GitHub) that holds all your frontend, backend, and DevOps code.

### ✅ Example of Monorepos

## ❓ Why Monorepos?

### Why Not Just Use Separate Folders?

You *can* and *should* — if:

1. Your services are highly decoupled (don’t share any code).
2. Your services don’t depend on each other.

🧠 For example: A codebase with a **Golang** service and a **JavaScript** service.

## 🛠️ Advantages of Monorepos

1. **Shared Code Reuse**
2. **Enhanced Collaboration**
3. **Optimized Builds and CI/CD**
   Tools like **Turborepo** offer smart caching and task execution strategies that significantly reduce build and test times.
4. **Centralized Tooling and Configuration**
   One set of linters, formatters, build tools, etc., for the whole codebase.

## 🚀 Why We’re Using Turborepo

Turborepo is currently one of the most relevant tools — it offers extra benefits like **build optimizations**.

## 🧱 Before You Dive In: Build Systems & Orchestrators

![Build System Diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/639f27cb-880c-4842-ade3-42e6a04afaf3)

### 🛠️ What is a Build System?

A **build system** automates the process of transforming source code into something that can be run on a computer.
For JS/TS projects, this includes:

* Transpilation (e.g., TS → JS)
* Bundling
* Minification
* Running tests
* Linting
* Deployment

---

### 🧩 What is a Build System Orchestrator?

A build system orchestrator (like **Turborepo**) doesn’t *do* the building — it *manages* it.

Turborepo allows you to define tasks that call other tools (e.g., `tsc`, `vite`) to do the actual work.

---

## 🚦 Turborepo as a Build System Orchestrator

Turborepo’s superpowers:

### 1. ⚡ Caching

Caches the output of tasks — if nothing has changed, it reuses results instead of running the task again.

### 2. 🧠 Dependency Graph Awareness

Knows which packages depend on each other and runs tasks in the correct order.

### 3. 🚀 Parallelization

Runs independent tasks in parallel — efficient resource usage = faster builds.
